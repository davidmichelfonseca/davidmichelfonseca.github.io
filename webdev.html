        <h1>Web Dev Journey</h1>
        <h2><strong>How I Started</strong></h2>
        <p>It all started with self-hosting. I've been obsessed with WordPress and Ghost in their early days. Through trial and error, I ran my first Ghost and WordPress sites on the now defunct NYC-based 6Sync's Ubuntu VPS.</p>
        <p>That was my first venture into web dev. Since then, I have wielded D3.js, CartoDB, and Kartograph to marry web hosting with data visualization. One of those initiatives – Conflict News – was cited by Vice News for using Open-source Intelligence (ONSIT) to report on active conflict zones.</p>
        <p>This is my first foray into web dev. I had previously tried reducing development time by using Framer or templates from Dribble, but I look forward to making the most of this exercise by Founders and Coders to sharpen those web dev skills.</p>        
        <h2><strong>Next Stop</strong></h2>
        <p>My next journey involves hopefully being a part of a cohort of incredible people that are looking at making the most of this opportunity:</p>
