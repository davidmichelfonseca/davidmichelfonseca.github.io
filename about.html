            <p><strong>^</strong> Yup, that's me. Sadly, not Keanu Reeves in The Matrix but clearly a massive fan</p>
        </div>        
        
        <h2><strong>Why Me?</strong></h2>
        <p>Iâ€™m data-driven, focused on innovation in technology, and determined to bootstrap my ventures. I worked in research, consultancy, a startup, and bootstrapped my own startup: Creative Street Ltd. Collectively considered, I have developed the necessary professional, quantitative research, and hands-on experience to succeed at Founders and Coders.</p>
        <h2><strong>Origin Story</strong></h2>
        <p>I was first exposed to programming after moving to India in 1997. I was introduced to Linux, open-source software (OSS), the Command Line Interface (CLI), and how the emergence of cable internet collapsed both space and time. Since then, I was able to launch an IBM-funded data visualization project on the costs of war (WarCount), encourage best practice in scraping (the Open Data Collective), and am working on launching Nomadian.app under the Creative Street Ltd. brand.</p>
        
        <h2><strong>What's Next</strong></h2>
        <p>This personal site harkens back to the days of MySpace, Geocities, and early days WordPress. While I'm a fan of using tools such as Framer on websites that I have created (<a href="https://nomadian.app" target="_blank">nomadian.app</a>), I wanted to recapture the chaos energy of websites in the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p>
        <p>In other pages, I link to my CV and socials. I hope that it provides you with a glimpse of my abilities. Hopefully they'll prove to be redeeming enough to pass to the next round, as this has been a humbling exercise.</p>
